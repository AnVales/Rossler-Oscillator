# Rossler-Oscillator

A study of the Rossler oscillator is carried out in this repository.

The codes made have been based on one made by Héctor Corte-León on 23/02/2013. In one of them a Rossler oscillator is modelled, and in two others there are two oscillators, a pair of coupled oscillators and two uncoupled oscillators.
