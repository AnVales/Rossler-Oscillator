# Rossler-Oscillator

A study of the Rossler oscillator is carried out in this repository.

- Three of the codes have been based on one made by Héctor Corte-León on 23/02/2013. In one of them a Rossler oscillator is modelled (single_oscillator), and in two others there are two oscillators, a pair of coupled oscillators (two_oscillators) and two uncoupled oscillators (two_oscillators_2).

- The other two perform a bifurcation diagram (roesller_bifurcation) and a return map (return_map) of a Rossler oscillator.
